1. Please work through this walkthrough with a pair partner. Please take turns on the keyboard as the driver as described in the pairing pill. Please swap driver/navigator roles following one of the protocols described in the pill ('change the message' is probably best), ensuring that the maximum time one person is driving is 15 minutes.

2. Make sure that in the end of this tutorial, both you and your partner have a fizzbuzz repo on your Github accounts.

3. It may take a bit of organising for you to set up some time to work with your pair partner on FizzBuzz. While you're sorting that out, you can work on the Student Directory. Instructions for starting Student Directory. Remember you can pair remotely if you're unable to meet up.
